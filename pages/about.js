          My name is Fynn Comerford and Iâ€™m currently studying Neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh. I am particularly interested in the development of stem cell and gene therapies.
      
          I also love venturing out into physics and philosophy, I am passionate about filmmaking and always up to any sorts of outdoor activity.
